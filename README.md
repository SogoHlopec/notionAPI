# Working with notion api
Basic templates and code examples for working with notion api in php and ModX.

First of all, for me from the future. But maybe this will also be useful and help someone.

I DO NOT think I have a good implementation of this functionality, but it works!

* **getData.php** - get data from Notion
* **setData.php** - check which pages are in the notion, create pages/update page data, delete irrelevant pages
* **modx_getData.php** - example of a snippet for ModX where we get data from Noiton, create/update resources with new data
* **modx_setData.php** - an example of a snippet for ModX where we check which pages are in notion, select resources and their data, load them into notion and create pages/update page data, delete irrelevant pages
